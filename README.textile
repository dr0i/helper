Collection of some helpful small programs

h2. *CompareTwoFiles*

Fast in doing a diff on two files.
*Build and Execute:*
* @mvn clean install exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="de.dr0i.helper.CompareTwoFiles" -Dexec.args="fileA fileB"@
FileA and fileB are absolute filenames.
If you want to know which lines are part of file*A* AND NOT of file*B* the -Dexec.args="fileA fileB" is the right one. If you instead want to know which lines are part of file*B* BUT NOT of file*A* you switch the order, like: -Dexec.args="fileB fileA".

h2. Elasticsearch reindexing

Bulks download an elasticsearch index using `scroll_id` and index this into
a new index. Makes use of https://github.com/moshe/elasticsearch_loader. Should
work with ES version >2.4
