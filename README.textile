h1. About

Collection of some helpful small programs

E.g. *CompareTwoFiles* which is really fast in doing a diff on two files.

h2. Build and Execute

* @mvn clean install exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="de.dr0i.helper.CompareTwoFiles" -Dexec.args="fileA fileB"@

FileA and fileB are absolute filenames.
If you want to know which lines are part of file*A* AND NOT of file*B* the -Dexec.args="fileA fileB" is the right one. If you instead want to know which lines are part of file*B* BUT NOT of file*A* you switch the order, like: -Dexec.args="fileB fileA".
